## Introduction

**_(on Wordpress Plugins Store & API documentation)_**

This Shopify extension uses the Sendy Fulfilment API to allow you to automate the processes of consigning and delivering with Sendy Fulfilment.

## Features

- **Collect geolocation**: this extension adds a geolocation field to your checkout page that uses the google address autocomplete API to collect geolocation info from your customers.
- **Request deliveries**: when your buyer completes a checkout on your site, the extension will automatically create a delivery request on the Sendy fulfilment app with the buyer and the product information. You will also get an email alert confirming that the order has been created on the Sendy Fulfilment app.
- **Track deliveries**: this extension will create a track delivery button on your order confirmation page which will allow your buyers to open and track the order in realtime.
